## Part Two: Cell Material Experiment
### Question One:
Produce a boxplot of the lab data showing the number of cells alive on each of the substrates.

### Question Two:
Compute the percent of cells dead on each of the substrates along with the standard error.  
*se = s/(n^(1/2))*

### Question Three
Produce a barplot showing the percent of cells dead on each of the substrates along with standard error error bars.

### Question Four:
Identify which substrates facilitated cellular attachment.
- It is difficult to infer from data taken over a short period of time which
materials will support long term growth. For this reason, the term 'facilitated'
has been interpreted to ask which materials had the highest average number of cells 
alive.
- In this data set, tissue culture plastic had both the highest mean and median,
with a mean of 312.4 and median of 306.0 cells.
- Any other material whose mean has no significant difference from tcp is also
considered to facilitate cell growth. The only material to fit this criteria is
the original plating with a p-value of 0.89.

### Question Five:
Identify which substrates substrates prevented cellular attachment
- The substrate with the lowest mean number of cells alive and any substrate
whose mean had no significant difference were considered to prevent cellular
attachment.
- The substrate with the lowest mean was teflon, with a mean of 24.2. 
- Brass, with a p-value of 0.3 had no significant difference in its mean.  

### Question Six:
Which substrates resulted in a large proportion of cell death?
- Brass and teflon had the highest proportions of cell death with 
36.0% and 37.0% dead, respectively

### Question Seven
Which substrates resulted in a small proportion of cell death?
- The original plating and tcp had the lowest proportions of cell death
with 1.5% and 3.0%, respectively.   

### Question Eight
Explain the results of the cell viability lab using your knowledge of cellular
interactions with substrates and the details of the experiment that was performed.
- Each material either facilitated or prevented cell growth because of its surface 
and chemical compositions.
- The tissue culture plastic (tcp) most facilitated cell growth. Tcp's performance
was likely due to a plating which is biomimetically designed to encourage cell adhesion.
- Brass and Teflon most prevented cell growth. 
- Brass' poor performance was most likely due to its composition of zinc and copper. 
- Ions from copper disrupt the natural potential difference across the cell membrane 
and weaken it.
- Teflon's poor performance was most likely due to its fluorine composition and resulting
hydrophobic properties. This hydrophobic quality reduces the strength of London Dispersion
forces and prevents cell attachment.
- Aluminum did a good job of facilitating cell growth, relative to brass and Teflon. However, this 
is most likely due to the short duration of the experiment. Over a long period of time,
aluminum will become cytotoxic to cells and suppress necessary ion release, within cells.
This will lead to a high mortality rate.
- Finally, stainless steel performed moderately well. This performance is sustainable 
because of its properties as an alloy. This artificial composition prevents corrosion
and release of toxic ions which may disrupt cell function.
