### Question 2. 
Describe the relationship between regression and correlation?
- Both Correlation and Regression both pertain to relationships among variables.
- Regression is a tool used to identify the relationship between different variables
- Correlation measures the strength of the linear association of two variables

### Question 3. 
What are the assumptions of linear regression and how each is checked?
- Assumption One: The data follows a linear relationship  
Check One: visualize the data in a plot
- Assumtion Two: homogeneity of variance  
Check Two: plotting the residuals against x or ^y
- Assumtion Three: Independence between y-values and error values  
Check Three: Plot the residuals
- Assumption Four: the populations y-values and the error terms are normally distributed for each predictor variable x.  
Check Four: qqnorm plot of the errors
- Assumption Five: x-value controlled by the researcher

### Question 4. 
What are the diagnostics for linear regression and what do they measure?
- Diagnostic One: Leverage  
A measure of how extreme an observation is for the x variable.  
*An observation with a high leverage is an outlier*
- Diagnostic Two: Residuals   
Used to check the regression assumptions, such as homogeneity of variance
- Diagnostic Three: Influence  
Measures the influence each observation has on the fitted regression line
and the estimates of the regression parameters.  
*ex) Cook's Distance yields the shift in the estimated parameter from
fitting a regression when a particular observation is omitted.*
